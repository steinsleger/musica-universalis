## Overview

This application allows users to explore the relationship between planetary orbits and musical harmonies by transforming astronomical data into sound. It implements Walter Murch's modification of the Titius-Bode Law, which reveals fascinating connections between the mathematical ratios of orbital distances and musical intervals.

The tool allows users to:
- Visualize planetary orbits in real-time with accurate elliptical paths
- Hear the corresponding musical tones for each planet
- Adjust the base frequency to explore different harmonic relationships
- Toggle planets on and off to hear specific combinations
- Experience the frequency shifts that occur as planets move through their orbits
- Play sequential harmonies with adjustable tempo and looping

## The Modified Titius-Bode Formula

This project utilizes Walter Murch's version of the Titius-Bode formula:

`f(n) = (1 + 2^n) √ó 3 √ó baseFrequency`

Where:
- `n` is an integer representing the orbital position (-2 for Venus, -1 for Earth, 0 for Mars, etc.)
- `baseFrequency` is a user-adjustable reference frequency

This formula demonstrates how orbital distances follow a mathematical pattern that, when converted to sound, creates harmonious musical relationships. Walter Murch's insight connects the mathematical logic of Johannes Kepler's "Music of the Spheres" with modern astronomical observations.

- Mathematical models based on Kepler's laws of planetary motion
- SVG for smooth, scalable orbit visualization

### Audio Safety Measures

The application implements sophisticated frequency-dependent volume scaling to protect users' hearing. Features include:

1. **Logarithmic Volume Scaling**: Higher frequencies are automatically attenuated based on a logarithmic curve
2. **Fletcher-Munson Equal-Loudness Contours**: Optional modeling of human hearing sensitivity across the frequency spectrum
3. **High-Frequency Protection**: Additional volume reduction for potentially harmful high frequencies
4. **Smooth Transitions**: Gradual volume changes to prevent clicks and pops
5. **Volume Limits**: Minimum and maximum gain thresholds to ensure audibility without distortion

This comprehensive approach ensures a pleasant and safe listening experience across the entire frequency range, from the lowest notes of the outer planets to the highest tones of the inner solar system.

## Visualization Details

The orbital visualization implements these features:

1. **Elliptical Orbits**: Planets follow elliptical paths based on their eccentricity
2. **Orbital Markers**: Visual indicators for perihelion (closest approach) and aphelion (furthest distance)
3. **Distance Display**: Real-time calculation and display of current distance in astronomical units (AU)
4. **Relative Sizing**: Planets are shown with relative sizing (not to astronomical scale)
5. **Color Coding**: Each planet has a distinctive color for easy identification

## Academic Background

This project is based on Walter Murch's research on the Titius-Bode Law and its relationship to musical harmonies. Murch, an acclaimed film editor and sound designer, has extensively studied and refined this astronomical theory, showing how the mathematical ratios of planetary orbits correspond to musical intervals.

His work suggests that there may be deeper underlying patterns in the structure of planetary systems that can be perceived through both visual and auditory means, revealing a fascinating connection between astronomy, mathematics, and music.
