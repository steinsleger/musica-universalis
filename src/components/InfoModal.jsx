          <h2>Murch's Modified Titius-Bode Formula</h2>
          <p>This project utilizes Walter Murch's version of the Titius-Bode formula:</p>
          <code>r = 1 + 2^n √ó 3</code>
          <p>Where:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>r</code> is the distance from the Sun in units of Œ≤ (the minimum stable orbit distance)</li>
            <li><code>n</code> is an integer that can be positive or negative, representing the orbital position</li>
            <li><code>Œ≤</code> is the reference unit, representing the theoretical minimum distance at which an object could maintain a stable orbit around the Sun</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>The n-values used for the planets in our solar system are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mercury: n = -10 (approaching the Œ≤ limit)</li>
            <li>Venus: n = -2</li>
            <li>Earth: n = -1</li>
            <li>Mars: n = 0</li>
            <li>Ceres: n = 1</li>
            <li>Jupiter: n = 2</li>
            <li>Saturn: n = 3</li>
            <li>Uranus: n = 4</li>
            <li>Neptune: n = 5</li>
            <li>Pluto: n = 6</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>For audio conversion, we map these orbital distances to frequencies using:</p>
          <code>frequency = baseFrequency √ó r</code>
          <p>Where <code>baseFrequency</code> is a user-adjustable reference frequency.</p>

          <p>Murch's insight was to establish Œ≤ as the reference point (instead of Earth's distance as in the original formulation), which considerably simplifies the mathematical expression while maintaining the same ratio relationships between orbits.</p>

          <h2>Academic Background</h2>
          <p>This project is based on Walter Murch's research on the Titius-Bode Law and its relationship to musical harmonies. Murch, an acclaimed film editor and sound designer, has extensively studied and refined this astronomical theory, showing how the mathematical ratios of planetary orbits correspond to musical intervals.</p>
          <p>His work suggests that there may be deeper underlying patterns in the structure of planetary systems that can be perceived through both visual and auditory means, revealing a fascinating connection between astronomy, mathematics, and music.</p>
